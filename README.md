# Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp Module 03 - Challenge: App Code Completion > Employee Payroll Tracker Starter Code

## Description

The Employee Payroll Tracker is a web-based, browser-accessible application that enables a Payroll Manager (User) to view and manage Employee Payroll Data. 
The app dynamically updates the web-app HTML and CSS code to ingest, analyze, and report User-input data, using JavaScript code. 
The web-app will resolve on multiple screen sizes, but does not cache or store User-input data across sessions (i.e., User-input data is deleted when a User session ends).

## Installation

No Installation of the Employee Payroll Tracker is required; the web-app is (nominally) cloud-based, accessed through any modern browser that supports JavaScript.


## Usage

The Employee Payroll Tracker is "intended" for use by Payroll Managers to input, and immediately perform basic analysis upon simple Employee Data (i.e., Name, Salary).
